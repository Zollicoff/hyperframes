# Step 1: Capture & Understand

## Run the capture

If `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) is set in the environment, the capture will automatically generate AI-powered image descriptions for every downloaded asset using Gemini 2.5 Flash vision — this significantly improves asset understanding for video production. The free Gemini API tier has a 5 RPM rate limit (captioning is batched accordingly); a paid API key removes this bottleneck.

```bash
npx hyperframes capture <URL> -o captures/<project-name>
```

If the built CLI isn't available, fall back to:

```bash
npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts capture <URL> -o captures/<project-name>
```

Wait for it to complete. Print how many screenshots, assets, sections, and fonts were extracted.

## Read and summarize

Read each file below. After reading each one, **write a 1-2 sentence summary** of what you learned. These summaries are your working memory — the raw file content may be cleared from context later.

### Must read (do not skip)

1. **View the scroll screenshots** (NOT the full-page.png — it's too tall and compressed to read). View these in order:
   - `screenshots/scroll-0.png` — the hero section at full 1920x1080 resolution. This is the most important image. Describe: is the background light or dark? What's the dominant visual element? What colors jump out?
   - `screenshots/scroll-25.png` — the page at 25% scroll depth
   - `screenshots/scroll-50.png` — the page at 50% scroll depth
   - `screenshots/scroll-75.png` — the page at 75% scroll depth
   - `screenshots/scroll-100.png` — the footer area

   After viewing all five, write 3-4 sentences describing the site's visual mood, layout patterns, color strategy, and overall feel.

2. **`extracted/tokens.json`** — Note the top 5-7 colors (HEX), all font families, number of sections, and number of headings/CTAs.

3. **`extracted/visible-text.txt`** — Note the site's headline, tagline, key selling points, and any notable statistics or social proof.

4. **`extracted/asset-descriptions.md`** — One-line-per-file summary of all downloaded assets. Note which assets are most visually striking or useful for video (hero images, logos, product screenshots).

### Read if they exist

5. **`extracted/animations.json`** — Note if the site uses scroll-triggered animations, marquees, canvas/WebGL, or named CSS animations.

6. **`extracted/lottie-manifest.json`** — View each preview image at `assets/lottie/previews/` to see what the animations look like.

7. **`extracted/video-manifest.json`** — View each preview at `assets/videos/previews/` to see what each video shows.

8. **`extracted/shaders.json`** — If present, this contains the actual GLSL shader code that powers the site's WebGL visual effects (gradient waves, particle systems, noise fields). Read the fragment shaders to extract: color values used in gradients, noise algorithms, blend functions. You can recreate similar effects in your compositions using Canvas 2D or by embedding the shader patterns with a `<canvas>` + WebGL context. See the Canvas 2D and procedural art patterns in `techniques.md`.

### On-demand (read when building scenes)

9. **Individual images in `assets/`** — Use `asset-descriptions.md` as your index. View specific images when you need them for a beat.

10. **`extracted/assets-catalog.json`** — Use to find remote URLs when you need an asset that wasn't downloaded.

### For rich captures (30+ images)

Launch a sub-agent to view all images and SVGs:

> "Read every image in assets/ and every SVG in assets/svgs/. For each, write one line: filename — what it shows, dominant colors, approximate size. Return the complete catalog."

Use the sub-agent's catalog as your asset reference for the rest of the workflow.

## Gate

Print your site summary before proceeding to Step 2:

- **Site:** [name]
- **Colors:** [top 3-5 HEX values with roles]
- **Fonts:** [font families]
- **Sections:** [count] sections, [count] headings, [count] CTAs
- **Key assets:** [3-5 most useful assets for video]
- **Vibe:** [one sentence describing the visual identity]
