description: Create video compositions, animations, title cards, overlays, captions, voiceovers, audio-reactive visuals, and scene transitions in HyperFrames HTML. Use when asked to build any HTML-based video content, add captions or subtitles synced to audio, generate text-to-speech narration, create audio-reactive animation (beat sync, glow, pulse driven by music), add animated text highlighting (marker sweeps, hand-drawn circles, burst lines, scribble, sketchout), or add transitions between scenes (crossfades, wipes, reveals, shader transitions). Covers composition authoring, timing, media, and the full video production workflow. For CLI commands (init, lint, preview, render, transcribe, tts) see the hyperframes-cli skill.

# HyperFrames

HTML is the source of truth for video. A composition is an HTML file with `data-*` attributes for timing, a GSAP timeline for animation, and CSS for appearance. The framework handles clip visibility, media playback, and timeline sync.

## Approach

### Step 0: Design system

Check for a `design.md` in the project root. If one exists, read it — it defines colors, typography, motion, and mood for all compositions in this project.

If none exists, **ask the user before proceeding:**

> "No design system found for this project. I can create one — I'll show you 2-3 visual directions to choose from, and the one you pick becomes the design system for all compositions. This takes a minute but makes every composition more consistent. Want to do that, or should I use defaults?"

If yes → generate a design picker page and serve it for the user to choose from. If no → follow [house-style.md](./house-style.md) defaults.

**Creating a design.md:**

Before generating options, read the style references — all generated options must comply with these rules:

- [references/typography.md](references/typography.md) — banned font list, cross-category pairing (serif + sans or sans + mono, never two sans-serifs), weight contrast (300-400 body / 700-900 headline), video-sized text (60px+ headlines, 20px+ body, 16px+ labels)
- [house-style.md](house-style.md) — lazy defaults to avoid (no gradient text, no left-edge accent stripes, no pure #000/#fff, no identical card grids, no banned fonts)
- [references/motion-principles.md](references/motion-principles.md) — ease diversity, varied entry directions, scene structure

1. Generate 2-3 visual directions based on the prompt. Each direction needs: name, mood, colors (bg/fg/accent), fonts (headline/body), energy level, and transition style.
2. Copy [templates/design-picker.html](templates/design-picker.html) to the project directory as `.hyperframes/pick-design.html`.
3. Replace `__ARCHITECTURES_JSON__`, `__PALETTES_JSON__`, and `__TYPEPAIRS_JSON__` with your generated options. The user picks one from each category independently — structure, palette, type pairing, plus theme (dark/light/full palette), corners, density, and depth.
   - Each architecture object must include a `preview_html` field — the HTML that renders in the preview panel. Use token placeholders that the template replaces at runtime: `{{bg}}`, `{{fg}}`, `{{ac}}`, `{{mt}}`, `{{hf}}`, `{{hw}}`, `{{bf}}`, `{{bw}}`, `{{cr}}` (corner radius), `{{pad}}`, `{{gap}}`, `{{shadow}}`, `{{g}}` (grid line color), `{{fg3}}`/`{{fg6}}`/`{{fg8}}`/`{{fg15}}` (fg at opacity), `{{ac3}}`/`{{ac5}}`/`{{ac25}}` (accent at opacity).
   - **Every token must be used.** Apply `{{cr}}` to all cards, buttons, and containers. Apply `{{shadow}}` to elevated elements (cards, buttons, code blocks). Apply `{{pad}}` and `{{gap}}` to control spacing. If a token isn't used in the preview_html, that option will have no visible effect.
   - **Density matters.** Each architecture preview must include 15+ distinct elements to give the user a real sense of the layout. Include: headline, subhead, body paragraph, label/overline, stat with number, secondary stat, quote/testimonial, attribution, card with title+body, second card (different treatment), code/command block, primary button, secondary button, list or tags, accent divider/rule, and a data element (table row, progress bar, or chart). The preview should feel like a full composition, not a sparse mockup.
   - Optionally include `components` (component styling rules) and `dos` (do's and don'ts) as strings — these appear in the generated design.md.
   - **Layout constraint:** All preview HTML must use percentage widths or `max-width: 100%`. Use `flex-wrap: wrap` on all flex rows. Absolute-positioned decoratives must stay within a parent with `overflow: hidden`.
   - **Palette variety:** Always include a mix of light, dark, and tinted backgrounds across the 6 palettes — even for calm/wellness prompts. A meditation app can be deep indigo + soft gold, not just cream + sage. This ensures the "Full palette" theme mode produces meaningfully different results per palette.
4. Serve the page: `npx hyperframes preview` or `python3 -m http.server <port>`. Before giving the user the URL, verify the server is responding: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:<port>/pick-design.html` — only share the link if it returns 200.
5. Once the user picks, write `design.md` to the project root with the chosen values:

```markdown
# Design System

## Mood

[1-2 sentence description]

## Colors

- Background: #hex — role
- Foreground: #hex — role
- Accent: #hex — role

## Typography

- Headline: [family], weight [N]
- Body: [family], weight [N]

## Motion

- Energy: calm | medium | high
- Eases: [list of preferred eases for this energy]
- Entrance patterns: [typical entrance directions and transforms]

## Transitions

- Primary: [type] — [duration]
- Accent: [type] — [duration]
```

### Using design.md during construction

If a `design.md` exists (from Step 0 or provided by the user), it is the source of truth for all visual decisions. Use only the values it defines — colors, fonts, spacing, corners, depth, component treatments, and any other fields the user has added. Do not invent new colors, substitute fonts, or override its rules. If the composition needs a value the design.md doesn't cover, follow [house-style.md](./house-style.md) for that specific decision.

### Step 1: Plan

Before writing HTML, think at a high level:

1. **What** — what should the viewer experience? Identify the narrative arc, key moments, and emotional beats.
2. **Structure** — how many compositions, which are sub-compositions vs inline, what tracks carry what (video, audio, overlays, captions).
3. **Timing** — which clips drive the duration, where do transitions land, what's the pacing.
4. **Layout** — build the end-state first. See "Layout Before Animation" below.
5. **Animate** — then add motion using the rules below.

For small edits (fix a color, adjust timing, add one element), skip straight to the rules.

### Multi-scene builds (4+ scenes)

For compositions with 4 or more scenes, build in three phases instead of one pass. A single pass produces shallow results — detail drops as context fills with boilerplate.

**Phase 1: Scaffold.** Build the HTML skeleton yourself:

- All scene `<div>` elements with `data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-track-index`
- The root composition container with `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`
- The GSAP timeline backbone: `gsap.timeline({ paused: true })`, `window.__timelines` registration
- All transition code between scenes (read [references/transitions.md](references/transitions.md))
- Global CSS: body reset, scene positioning, font declarations, the `design.md` palette as CSS
- Leave each scene's inner content empty: `<div id="scene1" class="scene"><!-- SCENE 1 CONTENT --></div>`

**Phase 2: Scene subagents.** Dispatch one subagent per scene, running in parallel. Each subagent receives:

- The `design.md` (or its values summarized)
- The global animation rules from the prompt
- That scene's specific prompt section only
- Instructions: "Write your output to `.hyperframes/scenes/sceneN.html` as a single file with three clearly marked sections: `<!-- HTML -->`, `<!-- CSS -->`, `<!-- GSAP -->`. Use the timeline variable `tl`. Start tweens at `{start_time}`. Do not create the timeline or register it — the parent handles that. **Use `immediateRender: false` on every `tl.from()` and `tl.fromTo()` call** — without it, the FROM state renders at time 0, making elements invisible before the scene's transition reveals them."

Each subagent focuses its entire context on making ONE scene visually rich: parallax layers, micro-animations, kinetic typography, ambient motion, background decoratives. No boilerplate, no other scenes. **Each subagent must write to a file** — text returned in conversation is not accessible to the assembly agent.

**Phase 3: Assembly.** Read each scene file from `.hyperframes/scenes/` and:

- Extract the HTML, CSS, and GSAP blocks from each `sceneN.html`
- Inject HTML into the scaffold's empty scene divs
- Merge CSS blocks into the style element (check for ID conflicts — prefix with scene ID if needed)
- Merge GSAP tweens into the single timeline (adjust start times if subagent used relative offsets)
- Run `npx hyperframes lint` and fix any structural issues
- Run `npx hyperframes validate` if available

## Layout Before Animation

Position every element where it should be at its **most visible moment** — the frame where it's fully entered, correctly placed, and not yet exiting. Write this as static HTML+CSS first. No GSAP yet.

**Why this matters:** If you position elements at their animated start state (offscreen, scaled to 0, opacity 0) and tween them to where you think they should land, you're guessing the final layout. Overlaps are invisible until the video renders. By building the end state first, you can see and fix layout problems before adding any motion.

### The process

1. **Identify the hero frame** for each scene — the moment when the most elements are simultaneously visible. This is the layout you build.
2. **Write static CSS** for that frame. The `.scene-content` container MUST fill the full scene using `width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: Npx;` with `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: Npx; box-sizing: border-box`. Use padding to push content inward — NEVER `position: absolute; top: Npx` on a content container. Absolute-positioned content containers overflow when content is taller than the remaining space. Reserve `position: absolute` for decoratives only.
3. **Add entrances with `gsap.from()`** — animate FROM offscreen/invisible TO the CSS position. The CSS position is the ground truth; the tween describes the journey to get there.
4. **Add exits with `gsap.to()`** — animate TO offscreen/invisible FROM the CSS position.

### Example

```css
/* scene-content fills the scene, padding positions content */
.scene-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 120px 160px;
  gap: 24px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
.title {
  font-size: 120px;
}
.subtitle {
  font-size: 42px;
}
/* Container fills any scene size (1920x1080, 1080x1920, etc).
   Padding positions content. Flex + gap handles spacing. */
```

**WRONG — hardcoded dimensions and absolute positioning:**

```css
.scene-content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 200px;
  left: 160px;
  width: 1920px;
  height: 1080px;
  display: flex; /* ... */
}
```

```js
// Step 3: Animate INTO those positions
tl.from(".title", { y: 60, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: "power3.out" }, 0);
tl.from(".subtitle", { y: 40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power3.out" }, 0.2);
tl.from(".logo", { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);

// Step 4: Animate OUT from those positions
tl.to(".title", { y: -40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.in" }, 3);
tl.to(".subtitle", { y: -30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.1);
tl.to(".logo", { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.2);
```

### When elements share space across time

If element A exits before element B enters in the same area, both should have correct CSS positions for their respective hero frames. The timeline ordering guarantees they never visually coexist — but if you skip the layout step, you won't catch the case where they accidentally overlap due to a timing error.

### What counts as intentional overlap

Layered effects (glow behind text, shadow elements, background patterns) and z-stacked designs (card stacks, depth layers) are intentional. The layout step is about catching **unintentional** overlap — two headlines landing on top of each other, a stat covering a label, content bleeding off-frame.

## Data Attributes

### All Clips

| Attribute          | Required                          | Values                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`               | Yes                               | Unique identifier                                      |
| `data-start`       | Yes                               | Seconds or clip ID reference (`"el-1"`, `"intro + 2"`) |
| `data-duration`    | Required for img/div/compositions | Seconds. Video/audio defaults to media duration.       |
| `data-track-index` | Yes                               | Integer. Same-track clips cannot overlap.              |
| `data-media-start` | No                                | Trim offset into source (seconds)                      |
| `data-volume`      | No                                | 0-1 (default 1)                                        |

`data-track-index` does **not** affect visual layering — use CSS `z-index`.

### Composition Clips

| Attribute                    | Required | Values                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `data-composition-id`        | Yes      | Unique composition ID                        |
| `data-duration`              | Yes      | Takes precedence over GSAP timeline duration |
| `data-width` / `data-height` | Yes      | Pixel dimensions (1920x1080 or 1080x1920)    |
| `data-composition-src`       | No       | Path to external HTML file                   |

## Composition Structure

Sub-compositions loaded via `data-composition-src` use a `<template>` wrapper. **Standalone compositions (the main index.html) do NOT use `<template>`** — they put the `data-composition-id` div directly in `<body>`. Using `<template>` on a standalone file hides all content from the browser and breaks rendering.

Sub-composition structure:

```html
<template id="my-comp-template">
  <div data-composition-id="my-comp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080">
    <!-- content -->
    <style>
      [data-composition-id="my-comp"] {
        /* scoped styles */
      }
    </style>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
      const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
      // tweens...
      window.__timelines["my-comp"] = tl;
    </script>
  </div>
</template>
```

Load in root: `<div id="el-1" data-composition-id="my-comp" data-composition-src="compositions/my-comp.html" data-start="0" data-duration="10" data-track-index="1"></div>`

## Video and Audio

Video must be `muted playsinline`. Audio is always a separate `<audio>` element:

```html
<video
  id="el-v"
  data-start="0"
  data-duration="30"
  data-track-index="0"
  src="video.mp4"
  muted
  playsinline
></video>
<audio
  id="el-a"
  data-start="0"
  data-duration="30"
  data-track-index="2"
  src="video.mp4"
  data-volume="1"
></audio>
```

## Timeline Contract

- All timelines start `{ paused: true }` — the player controls playback
- Register every timeline: `window.__timelines["<composition-id>"] = tl`
- Framework auto-nests sub-timelines — do NOT manually add them
- Duration comes from `data-duration`, not from GSAP timeline length
- Never create empty tweens to set duration

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**Deterministic:** No `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or time-based logic. Use a seeded PRNG if you need pseudo-random values (e.g. mulberry32).

**GSAP:** Only animate visual properties (`opacity`, `x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotation`, `color`, `backgroundColor`, `borderRadius`, transforms). Do NOT animate `visibility`, `display`, or call `video.play()`/`audio.play()`.

**Animation conflicts:** Never animate the same property on the same element from multiple timelines simultaneously.

**No `repeat: -1`:** Infinite-repeat timelines break the capture engine. Calculate the exact repeat count from composition duration: `repeat: Math.ceil(duration / cycleDuration) - 1`.

**Synchronous timeline construction:** Never build timelines inside `async`/`await`, `setTimeout`, or Promises. The capture engine reads `window.__timelines` synchronously after page load. Fonts are embedded by the compiler, so they're available immediately — no need to wait for font loading.

**Never do:**

1. Forget `window.__timelines` registration
2. Use video for audio — always muted video + separate `<audio>`
3. Nest video inside a timed div — use a non-timed wrapper
4. Use `data-layer` (use `data-track-index`) or `data-end` (use `data-duration`)
5. Animate video element dimensions — animate a wrapper div
6. Call play/pause/seek on media — framework owns playback
7. Create a top-level container without `data-composition-id`
8. Use `repeat: -1` on any timeline or tween — always finite repeats
9. Build timelines asynchronously (inside `async`, `setTimeout`, `Promise`)
10. Use `gsap.set()` on clip elements from later scenes — they don't exist in the DOM at page load. Use `tl.set(selector, vars, timePosition)` inside the timeline at or after the clip's `data-start` time instead.
11. Use `<br>` in content text — forced line breaks don't account for actual rendered font width. Text that wraps naturally + a `<br>` produces an extra unwanted break, causing overlap. Let text wrap via `max-width` instead. Exception: short display titles where each word is deliberately on its own line (e.g., "THE\nIMMORTAL\nGAME" at 130px).

## Scene Transitions (Non-Negotiable)

Every multi-scene composition MUST follow ALL of these rules. Violating any one of them is a broken composition.

1. **ALWAYS use transitions between scenes.** No jump cuts. No exceptions.
2. **ALWAYS use entrance animations on every scene.** Every element animates IN via `gsap.from()`. No element may appear fully-formed. If a scene has 5 elements, it needs 5 entrance tweens.
3. **NEVER use exit animations** except on the final scene. This means: NO `gsap.to()` that animates opacity to 0, y offscreen, scale to 0, or any other "out" animation before a transition fires. The transition IS the exit. The outgoing scene's content MUST be fully visible at the moment the transition starts.
4. **Final scene only:** The last scene may fade elements out (e.g., fade to black). This is the ONLY scene where `gsap.to(..., { opacity: 0 })` is allowed.

**WRONG — exit animation before transition:**

```js
// BANNED — this empties the scene before the transition can use it
tl.to("#s1-title", { opacity: 0, y: -40, duration: 0.4 }, 6.5);
tl.to("#s1-subtitle", { opacity: 0, duration: 0.3 }, 6.7);
// transition fires on empty frame
```

**RIGHT — entrance only, transition handles exit:**

```js
// Scene 1 entrance animations
tl.from("#s1-title", { y: 50, opacity: 0, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out" }, 0.3);
tl.from("#s1-subtitle", { y: 30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.6);
// NO exit tweens — transition at 7.2s handles the scene change
// Scene 2 entrance animations
tl.from("#s2-heading", { x: -40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: "expo.out" }, 8.0);
```

## Animation Guardrails

- Offset first animation 0.1-0.3s (not t=0)
- Vary eases across entrance tweens — use at least 3 different eases per scene
- Don't repeat an entrance pattern within a scene
- Avoid full-screen linear gradients on dark backgrounds (H.264 banding — use radial or solid + localized glow)
- 60px+ headlines, 20px+ body, 16px+ data labels for rendered video
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on number columns

If no `design.md` was established in Step 0, follow [house-style.md](./house-style.md) for aesthetic defaults.

## Typography and Assets

- **Fonts:** Just write the `font-family` you want in CSS — the compiler embeds supported fonts automatically. If a font isn't supported, the compiler warns.
- Add `crossorigin="anonymous"` to external media
- For dynamic text overflow, use `window.__hyperframes.fitTextFontSize(text, { maxWidth, fontFamily, fontWeight })`
- All files live at the project root alongside `index.html`; sub-compositions use `../`

## Editing Existing Compositions

- Read the full composition first — match existing fonts, colors, animation patterns
- Only change what was requested
- Preserve timing of unrelated clips

## Output Checklist

- [ ] `npx hyperframes lint` and `npx hyperframes validate` both pass
- [ ] Contrast warnings addressed (see Quality Checks below)
- [ ] Animation choreography verified (see Quality Checks below)

## Quality Checks

### Contrast

`hyperframes validate` runs a WCAG contrast audit by default. It seeks to 5 timestamps, screenshots the page, samples background pixels behind every text element, and computes contrast ratios. Failures appear as warnings:

```
⚠ WCAG AA contrast warnings (3):
  · .subtitle "secondary text" — 2.67:1 (need 4.5:1, t=5.3s)
```

If warnings appear:

- On dark backgrounds: brighten the failing color until it clears 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text, 24px+ or 19px+ bold)
- On light backgrounds: darken it
- Stay within the palette family — don't invent a new color, adjust the existing one
- Re-run `hyperframes validate` until clean

Use `--no-contrast` to skip if iterating rapidly and you'll check later.

### Animation Map

After authoring animations, run the animation map to verify choreography:

```bash
node skills/hyperframes-animation-map/scripts/animation-map.mjs <composition-dir> \
  --out <composition-dir>/.hyperframes/anim-map
```

Outputs a single `animation-map.json` with:

- **Per-tween summaries**: `"#card1 animates opacity+y over 0.50s. moves 23px up. fades in. ends at (120, 200)"`
- **ASCII timeline**: Gantt chart of all tweens across the composition duration
- **Stagger detection**: reports actual intervals (`"3 elements stagger at 120ms"`)
- **Dead zones**: periods over 1s with no animation — intentional hold or missing entrance?
- **Element lifecycles**: first/last animation time, final visibility
- **Scene snapshots**: visible element state at 5 key timestamps
- **Flags**: `offscreen`, `collision`, `invisible`, `paced-fast` (under 0.2s), `paced-slow` (over 2s)

Read the JSON. Scan summaries for anything unexpected. Check every flag — fix or justify. Verify the timeline shows the intended choreography rhythm. Re-run after fixes.

Skip on small edits (fixing a color, adjusting one duration). Run on new compositions and significant animation changes.
