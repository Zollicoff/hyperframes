# Multi-Scene Build Pipeline

For compositions with 4 or more scenes, build in phases instead of one pass. A single pass produces shallow results — detail drops as context fills with boilerplate.

## Scene Fragment Spec

Every scene file (`.hyperframes/scenes/sceneN.html`) must be a **fragment**, not a standalone document. The assembler splits on markers and injects verbatim — non-compliant files break assembly.

### Structure

Exactly three sections, in this order, each appearing exactly once:

```
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="s3-heading">...</div>
...

<!-- CSS -->
.s3-heading { color: var(--fg); ... }
...

<!-- GSAP -->
var S3 = 14.3;
tl.set('#s3-heading', { opacity: 0, y: 30 }, 0);
tl.to('#s3-heading', { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.4 }, S3 + 0.5);
...
```

### Required

- **Three markers, one each:** `<!-- HTML -->`, `<!-- CSS -->`, `<!-- GSAP -->` — no duplicates
- **ID prefix:** All IDs and classes use `s{N}-` prefix (e.g., `#s3-heading`, `.s7-chart`)
- **GSAP pattern:** `tl.set()` at time 0 for initial state, `tl.to()` at scene time for animation
- **Scene start var:** Define `var SN = {start_time};` at top of GSAP section, reference it for all tweens
- **Finite repeats:** All `repeat` values must be explicit numbers, never `-1` or `Infinity`

### Prohibited

- `<!DOCTYPE`, `<html`, `<head`, `<body` — this is a fragment, not a document
- `<script>` or `</script>` tags — the GSAP section is raw JS, not wrapped in script tags. The scaffold's single `<script>` block receives the content directly. Nested script tags cause `Unexpected token '<'` parse errors.
- `<script src=` — no external script loading
- `gsap.timeline(` — the scaffold creates the timeline
- `window.__timelines` — the scaffold registers it
- `tl.from(` or `tl.fromTo(` — causes flash-of-default-state (use `tl.set` + `tl.to`)
- `body {` in CSS — the scaffold owns body styles
- `.scene {` in CSS — the scaffold owns scene base styles
- `position`, `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, `opacity`, or `z-index` on `#sceneN` — the scaffold owns the scene container; only style elements INSIDE the scene
- Bare class names without `s{N}-` prefix (`.heading`, `.card`, `.tendril`, `.crack`) — causes cross-scene collisions when two scenes use the same name
- CSS `transform` for centering (`translate(-50%, -50%)`) on elements that GSAP animates — GSAP overwrites the entire `transform` property, destroying the CSS centering. Use GSAP `xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50` in the `tl.set()` at time 0 instead.

### Contrast

All text elements must achieve **4.5:1 contrast ratio** (WCAG AA) against their scene background. Check especially:

- HUD labels, stats, and values against dark backgrounds
- Light-colored text on tinted/colored backgrounds
- Small text (under 24px) has no large-text exemption

Use the design.md foreground color for text. If an element needs a different color for visual effect, verify contrast manually.

### Assembly contract

If a scene file follows this spec, the assembler can:

1. Split on `<!-- HTML -->`, `<!-- CSS -->`, `<!-- GSAP -->` markers
2. Inject HTML between the scaffold's `<div id="sceneN" class="scene">` and `</div>`
3. Append CSS to the scaffold's `<style>` block
4. Append GSAP into the scaffold's `<script>` after transitions, before `window.__timelines` registration

No parsing, no stripping, no guessing.

## Phase 1: Scaffold

Build the HTML skeleton yourself:

- All scene `<div>` elements with `data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-track-index`
- The root composition container with `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`
- The GSAP timeline backbone: `gsap.timeline({ paused: true })`, `window.__timelines` registration
- All transition code between scenes (read [transitions.md](transitions.md))
- Global CSS: body reset, scene positioning, font declarations, the `design.md` palette as CSS
- Leave each scene's inner content empty: `<div id="scene1" class="scene"><!-- SCENE 1 CONTENT --></div>`
- **Visibility kills for every scene** including the last — after each scene's exit transition, add `tl.set("#sceneN", { visibility: "hidden" }, exitEndTime)`. The final scene needs this too (after its fade-out), or it remains partially visible when scrubbing.

## Phase 2: Scene subagents

Dispatch one subagent per scene, running in parallel. Each subagent receives:

- The **Scene Fragment Spec** (above) — the subagent must follow this exactly
- The `design.md` (or its values summarized)
- The global animation rules from the prompt
- That scene's specific prompt section only
- The scene number `N` and start time — used for the `s{N}-` prefix and `var SN = {start_time};`

Each subagent focuses its entire context on making ONE scene visually rich: parallax layers, micro-animations, kinetic typography, ambient motion, background decoratives. No boilerplate, no other scenes. **Each subagent must write to a file** — text returned in conversation is not accessible to the assembly agent.

## Phase 2b: Streaming evaluation

As each scene file appears in `.hyperframes/scenes/`, dispatch an evaluator subagent immediately — don't wait for all scenes to finish. The evaluator receives:

- The scene file
- The **Scene Fragment Spec** (above)
- That scene's section from the original prompt
- The `design.md`

### Evaluation order: format first, then content

**Step 1 — Format validation (instant FAIL if any check fails):**

- Exactly 3 markers (`<!-- HTML -->`, `<!-- CSS -->`, `<!-- GSAP -->`), each appearing once
- No prohibited patterns (DOCTYPE, html/head/body tags, `<script>`/`</script>` tags, script src, gsap.timeline, window.\_\_timelines, tl.from, body/scene CSS rules, CSS `transform` on GSAP-animated elements)
- All IDs and classes use `s{N}-` prefix
- No position/top/left/width/height/opacity/z-index on `#sceneN` in CSS
- All `repeat` values are finite numbers

**Step 2 — Content validation (only if format passes):**

- **Prompt adherence**: Does the scene include the elements the prompt described? List what's present and what's missing.
- **Design compliance**: Are the design.md colors, fonts, corners, and spacing used? Any invented values?
- **Contrast**: All text elements meet 4.5:1 against the scene background color. Check HUD labels, stats, and small text especially.
- **Density**: 15+ animated elements? 3 parallax layers?

The evaluator writes a verdict to `.hyperframes/scenes/sceneN.eval.md`: PASS or FAIL with specific issues. If FAIL, re-dispatch the scene subagent with the evaluator's feedback appended to the original instructions. Maximum 2 retries per scene — if a scene fails 3 times, escalate to the user with the evaluator's feedback and ask how to proceed. If PASS, the scene is ready for assembly.

Run evaluators concurrently with scene builds — a scene that finishes first gets evaluated first. The pipeline streams, not batches.

## Phase 3: Assembly

Once all scenes have PASS evaluations, read each scene file from `.hyperframes/scenes/` and:

1. Split each file on `<!-- HTML -->`, `<!-- CSS -->`, `<!-- GSAP -->` markers
2. Inject HTML into the scaffold's empty scene divs
3. Merge CSS blocks into the style element
4. Merge GSAP tweens into the single `<script>` after transitions, before `window.__timelines` registration
5. Run `npx hyperframes lint` and fix any structural issues
6. Run `npx hyperframes validate` if available
